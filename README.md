# Hi, I'm Rogerio

A passionate young developer from Brazil, currently 16 years old. I've been studying Java since I was 12 and have fallen in love with programming ever since. I'm always eager to learn new technologies, build cool projects, and improve my skills every day. I enjoy solving problems and sharing knowledge with others.

If you're working on exciting projects or just want to connect, feel free to reach out!
